$80,000 worth of wire transfers have hit the bank. I now have enough financial security to proceed with hardware work.

The first step is ensuring I can be paid a full-time salary. Comply with US tax laws, SEC regulations, etc. I predicted the exact numbers before going through the legal boilerplate and setup.

To save effort, serious work <i>probably</i> won't begin until Jan 2 2026. I can avoid filing a few tax return documents for the 2025 year. I will figure out some remaining tax and paperwork stuff during the last days of 2025.

Current estimate for the press release is Dec 18 2025.
